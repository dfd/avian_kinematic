This repo combines code and ideas from [avian's 3D kinematic character example](https://github.com/Jondolf/avian/tree/main/crates/avian3d/examples/kinematic_character_3d) and [Biped-Potato's fps tutorial](https://github.com/Biped-Potato/fps_tutorial/tree/tutorial/PART%202%20-%20Movement%2B3D%20Models) to create a first person perspective to the avian 3D kinematic character example.  It works with keyboard and mouse or gamepad inputs.
